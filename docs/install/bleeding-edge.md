## Download any other tagged release

For example:

- <https://s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/gitlab-runner-downloads/main/binaries/gitlab-runner-linux-386>
- <https://s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/gitlab-runner-downloads/latest/binaries/gitlab-runner-linux-386>
- <https://s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/gitlab-runner-downloads/v16.5.0/binaries/gitlab-runner-linux-386>

If you have problem downloading through `https`, fallback to plain `http`:

- <http://s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/gitlab-runner-downloads/main/binaries/gitlab-runner-linux-386>
- <http://s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/gitlab-runner-downloads/latest/binaries/gitlab-runner-linux-386>
