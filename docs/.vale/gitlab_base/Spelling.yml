# Warning: gitlab.Spelling
#
# Checks for possible spelling mistakes in content, not code. Results from links using angle brackets (<https://example.com>) should be corrected.
#
# If a word is flagged as a spelling mistake incorrectly, such as a product name,
# you can submit an MR to update `spelling-exceptions.txt` with the missing word.
# Commands, like `git clone` must use backticks, and must not be added to the
# exceptions.
#
# For a list of all options, see https://vale.sh/docs/topics/styles/
