# GitLab Runner

This is the repository of the official GitLab Runner written in Go.
It executes tests and sends the results to GitLab.

[GitLab CI](https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-ci) is the open-source
continuous integration service included with GitLab that coordinates the testing.
The old name of this project was GitLab CI Multi Runner but please use "GitLab Runner" (without CI) from now on.

### Closing issues

GitLab is growing very fast and we have limited resources to deal with
issues opened by community volunteers. We appreciate all the
contributions coming from our community, but we need to create some
closing policy to help all of us with issue management.

The issue tracker is not used for support or configuration questions. We
have dedicated [channels](https://about.gitlab.com/support/) for these
kinds of questions. The issue tracker should only be used for feature
requests, bug reports, and other tasks that need to be done for the
Runner project.

It is up to a project maintainer to decide if an issue is actually a
support/configuration question. Before closing the issue the maintainer
should leave a reason why this is a support/configuration question, to make
it clear to the issue author. They should also leave a comment using
[our template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/blob/main/PROCESS.md#support-requests-and-configuration-questions)
before closing the issue. The issue author has every right to disagree and
reopen the issue for further discussion.
